This is an R Markdown Notebook containing code used to analyse metadata of *Staphylococcus aureus* bacteremia in an Argentinean University Hospital during an 8-year period (2009-2016). A total of 326 *S. aureus* clinical isolates were recovered in three periods: P1: 2009-2010, P2: 2012-2014, and P3: 2015-2016. The results of each analysis appear beneath the code.
